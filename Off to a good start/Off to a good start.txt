Introduction

Welcome to Locus | One.

First off, if you haven't already, you really should join our Discord: https://discord.gg/hQAtPFr

Let’s establish a few rules to begin:

1) Each level of the puzzle is unlocked via a password-protected .7z file. Your job is to solve for the passwords.

2) No serious cryptography or deep knowledge of how to code will be needed to complete the puzzle. 
There’s a bit of grade-school level math at one point; the real trick is figuring out where. 
The chief skillsets required are curiosity and a willingness to seek relationships and patterns 
where at first there may seem to be none. You'll also likely want to keep notes. Google everything.

3) No real-world travel required; everything can be solved from an internet-connected computer.

Thank you in advance for being a part of our "first edition."
