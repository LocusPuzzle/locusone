Introduction

Welcome to Locus | One.

First off, if you haven't already, you really should join our Discord: https://discord.gg/hQAtPFr

Let’s establish a few rules to begin:

1) Each level of the puzzle is unlocked via a password-protected .7z file. Your job is to solve for the passwords.

2) A series of prologue levels of the puzzle will be released as the bounty reaches certain thresholds. 
(The first prologue chapter is already live for you to find; the second will drop when the bounty reaches 1 ETH, and so on.) 

3) On April 30th OR once the bounty reaches 5 ETH (whichever comes first), all remaining chapters of the puzzle 
will be released, and registration of new addresses into the game will be locked (this is to prevent players from 
waiting until just before solving the puzzle to stake the bounty). ***Only players who have staked the contract before
that point will be eligible to claim the bounty.***

4) No serious cryptography, or deep knowledge of how to code will be needed to complete the puzzle. 
There’s a bit of grade-school level math at one point; the real trick is figuring out where. 
The chief skillsets required are curiosity and a willingness to seek relationships and patterns 
where at first there may seem to be none. You'll also likely want to keep notes.

5) No real-world travel required; everything can be solved from an internet-connected computer.

Thank you in advance for being a part of our "first edition."
