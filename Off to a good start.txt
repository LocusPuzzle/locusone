Introduction

Let’s establish a few rules to begin:

1) No serious cryptography, or deep knowledge of how to code will be needed to complete the puzzle. There’s a bit of grade-school level math at one point; the real trick is figuring out where. The chief skillsets required are curiosity and a willingness to seek relationships and patterns where at first there may seem to be none.

2) No real-world travel required; everything can be solved from an internet-connected computer.

3) A series of standalone prologue chapters will trickle out as the jackpot reaches certain thresholds; once the bounty reaches 5 ETH (or April 30th, whichever comes first) Team Locus will release the remainder of the clues required to solve the puzzle.
